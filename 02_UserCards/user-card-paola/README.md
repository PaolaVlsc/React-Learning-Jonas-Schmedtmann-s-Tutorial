Skills Database
The card component includes a sample skills database for demonstration purposes. If you want to update or customize the skills, you can do so by modifying the skills array in the Card.js file. Each skill is represented by an object with properties:

skill: The name of the skill.
level: The skill level, which can be "beginner," "intermediate," or "advanced."
color: The color used to represent the skill in the card.
You can add, remove, or update skills in the skills array to match your requirements.

Component Structure
The card component is structured as follows:

Card component: The main component that represents the card structure. It consists of an Avatar, Introduction, and SkillList.

Avatar component: Displays the avatar or cover picture.

Introduction component: Provides a title and introduction text.

SkillList component: Renders a list of skills using the data from the skills database.

Skill component: Represents an individual skill within the skill list. It displays the skill name, level, and uses different emoji icons to indicate skill levels.
